# Benchmark

## Overview

VeriQ Benchmark is a benchmark for general tasks in Quantum Computing. It includes the most commonly used types of quantum circuits including combinational quantum circuits, dynamic quantum circuits, sequential quantum circuits, and variational quantum circuits. For every type of quantum circuit, we include the circuits of three scales, small scale (<30 qubits), medium scale (30-100 qubits), and large scale (>1000 qubits). We also provide a series of scrips for users to generate quantum circuits of arbitrary number of qubits.

The circuits in our benchmark are described using the OpenQASM quantum assembly language and provided as '.qasm' files. 

## Combinational Quantum Circuits

Combinational quantum circuit is the most basic but commonly used circuits in quantum computating. In this bechmark we give circuits for most basic quantum algorithms, reversible circuits, qubit mapping and random clifford circuits.


### Quantum Algorithm
